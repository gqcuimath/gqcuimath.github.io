Currently, I'm a first-year doctoral candidate at the [School of Mathematic Science](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. [Bin Zhou](https://bzhou1982.github.io/).
 I’m interested in **geometric analysis** and **nonlinear paitial differential equation**.
 My email is [gqcui25@stu.pku.edu.cn](gqcui25@stu.pku.edu.cn).
